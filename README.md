# QR code based Attendance system üìù

This project is an attempt to automate the **deadly dull** manual attendance process under digital tranformation.

## Need for the proposed system - A big WHY?

1. Malpractises by students which generates untruthful attendance data which is unfair.
2. Attendance marking manually is tedious & long process (sometimes feels like infinity) for teachers & students.
3. As mentioned above it takes significant chunk of time from the allotted time for the lecture moreover with tampered data.
4. Data collection, organization, report generation is exhausting process and is prone to cause errors.
5. As this whole process involves multiple parties and the subprocesses work independently there is lack of synchronization and seamless flow of data.

## Key Features

1. A simple web app for students, teachers and parents to operate, organize and monitor the attendance.
2. Proxy proof due to *time + student's unique id* binded QR code. (i.e., for e.g. a certain QR code is valid for only 35 min.)
3. Unique QR code for every student for every lecture; sent to respective students via e-mail.
4. In-built QR code scanner in teacher dashboard for close monitoring of attendance marking procedure.
5. Facility to organize and maintain the attendance data in teacher's module.
